# Overview

A code-along first principles build of a logistic regressor, sourced from the NeuralNine youtube channel, and can be found through this link:

The entire regressor is built using only numpy as an extermal package, and later tested on the sklearn breast cancer dataset.

## Summary

This notebook introduces the sigmoid and largely consists of a derivation of the loss function used in logistic regression. At the end, we will see a full implementation.

This code-along was deeply informative about the deep workingso of logistic regression, and sharpened my intuition for applying it to binary classification problems.
